# Category Pirates AI: Scaling Ideas Without Adding Headcount  

**Status:** Active Development  

## Concept  

Category Pirates has no shortage of bold ideas. What they don’t have is the bandwidth to turn every insight into premium content. Historically, this meant hiring ghostwriters, editors, and operators—costly and slow.  

By building a suite of AI-powered internal tools, ghostwriting systems, and a completely reimagined Academy experience, the team can now deliver more content without sacrificing voice or quality.  

Audience impact spans:  
- **Internal team** (faster workflows, AI-assisted writing, automated research)  
- **Category Design Academy members** (~10 per year)  
- **Substack subscribers** (1,000+ annually)  

## Core Features  

- **Ghostwriting Engine:**  
  - AI wrappers hyper-tuned for mini-book creation in the exact Category Pirates voice.  
  - Replaces the need for external editors.  

- **Modernized Academy Platform:**  
  - Rebuilt the outdated PDF workbook experience into a dynamic, personalized learning system.  
  - Integrated OpenAI Assistants and APIs to adapt the learning flow to each course and learner.  
  - All content is designed exclusively around Category Pirates frameworks and language.
  - Leveraged open-source **LibreChat** to host OpenAI assistants and other APIs.  

- **Other AI Tools:**  
  - AI-powered FAQ response system.  
  - Data ingestion for model and context training, ensuring the AI “thinks” like Category Pirates.  

## Technical Stack  

**Frontend / Platform**  
- LibreChat (customized)  
- Custom learning interface with integrated OpenAI Assistants  

**Backend & Infrastructure**  
- OpenAI API + Claude API orchestration  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for document search  
- Custom prompt engineering for high-fidelity responses  

## Skills & Contributions  

- Model fine-tuning for voice accuracy and quality.  
- Backend logic for integrating multiple AI models into a cohesive system.  
- UX flow design for the new Academy experience.  
- Data wrangling and cleaning to create strong training inputs for AI tools.  
- Prompt engineering for multiple assistant-based products.  

Worked in a two-person development team.  

## Results  

- **Content production speed:** 50% faster internal generation.  
- **Revenue impact:** 500% increase in paying member count after release of the 3rd party AI tool *Delphi*.  
- **Academy platform engagement:** TBD (new platform launching soon).
