# Tufts Legal Counsel Data Management System (JumboCode Project)  

## Concept  

The Tufts University Office of Legal Counsel managed a large volume of contracts and case information, including **hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive medical data**, using outdated, fragmented systems. This made searching, updating, and organizing legal records slow and inefficient.  

Our JumboCode team designed and delivered a modern data management platform to streamline operations, improve data accessibility, and enhance overall workflow efficiency.  

## Team  

- **Team Size:** 10 developers, 1 project manager  
- **My Role:** Frontend developer & database engineer  

## My Contributions  

- **Frontend Development:**  
  - Built user-facing interfaces using React and JavaScript for intuitive navigation and clear data visualization.  

- **Database & Integration:**  
  - Designed and configured a SQL database capable of managing **hundreds of gigabytes of medical and legal data**.  
  - Developed data integration pipelines to connect the frontend to the SQL backend.  

- **Collaboration:**  
  - Worked closely with backend developers to align database structure with Python API endpoints.  

## Impact  

- **Efficiency Gains:** Dramatically reduced time required for the legal team to locate and update records.  
- **Modernization:** Upgraded from manual or outdated processes to a centralized, scalable, and secure data platform.  
- **User Experience:** Delivered a cleaner, more accessible system tailored to the legal team’s workflows.
