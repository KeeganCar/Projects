# TheHuddle (React Native + Expo Example)

This is a demo of a social platform app built with Expo Router, Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage.
- 📱 Auth flow (sign-in / sign-up modal)
- 💬 Group system with posts and chat
- ☁️ Realtime Firestore updates
- 🖼️ Image uploads via Firebase Storage

To explore:
- `/index.tsx` → Auth entry point
- `/create-group.tsx`, `/create-post.tsx` → Firestore write examples
- `/(tabs)/` → Main app navigation
