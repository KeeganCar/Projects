This is a demo of a social platform app built with Expo Router, Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage.
- Auth flow (sign-in / sign-up modal)
- Group system with posts and chat
- Realtime Firestore updates
- Image uploads via Firebase Storage

To explore:
- `/create-group.tsx`, `/create-post.tsx` → Firestore write examples
- `/(tabs)/` → Main app navigation
